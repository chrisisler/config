Usage
----

Before just dropping these files in your home directory, `git-status-parse.sh` needs to be placed in a sensible spot somewhere with the rest of your code or Sh specific code.

Also, before using these files, you'll need https://github.com/mavnn/mintty-colors-solarized and https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug installed (requires curl).
